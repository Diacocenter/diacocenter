                            In 2012, considering the demand for precise industrial tools that we either created
                            ourselves or received inquiries from our clients, we made the decision to establish
                            DIACO. One of the first products registered with DIACO was a wire cut machine for
                            insulation materials. Actually, the idea for the Diaco platform emerged from analyzing
                            the needs and challenges existing in the technology market.
